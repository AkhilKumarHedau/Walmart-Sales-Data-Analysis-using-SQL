# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
üìä **End-to-End Retail Data Analysis Project using MySQL**

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart Sales Data using Structured Query Language (SQL).
The goal is to extract valuable business insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability.


üìÅ **Project Overview**

In this project, I built a complete SQL-based data analysis pipeline ‚Äî starting from database creation and data cleaning to feature engineering and exploratory analysis.

The analysis answers key business questions related to Product, Sales, and Customer performance, helping to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.


üß± **Database Design**

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. This dataset contains sales transactions from a three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows.

‚öôÔ∏è **Approach Used**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Wrangling**
	‚Ä¢	Built the database and table structure with all fields as NOT NULL to ensure data integrity.
	‚Ä¢	Checked for missing or null values.
	‚Ä¢	Ensured consistency in data types (decimal for monetary values, float for VAT, etc.).

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering**

To enhance the dataset for deeper analysis, new columns were created using SQL functions:

time_of_day - Derived from time column (CASE WHEN) - Classifies each sale into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening

day_name - Extracted using DAYNAME(date) - Identifies the day of the week for trend analysis

month_name - Extracted using MONTHNAME(date) - Helps analyze monthly revenue and COGS trends

These engineered features helped uncover temporal patterns in sales.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA was performed through a series of SQL queries addressing Product, Sales, and Customer dimensions.
